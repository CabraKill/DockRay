# DockRay
A docker manager with soft use.


![](README/main_window.png)

# Powered by *Flutter* ðŸ’™
Flutter enables cross-platform code, which helps achieve more users and write less code.
Seems perfect, right? It mighty be.

## Docker
Install docker and congfigure non-sudo execution for docker CLI.

## How does it work ?
DockRay calls docker CLI to get container's info and run actions.

Until there is a stable/official cross-platform docker lib to use, it shall be how it works.
